Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests.

Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_.

The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n\/\/ Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n\/\/ Waveform example:\n\/\/ time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n\/\/ 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n\/\/ 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n\/\/ 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n\/\/ 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n\/\/ 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n\/\/ 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n\/\/ 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n\/\/ 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n\/\/ 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n\/\/ 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n\/\/ 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n\/\/ 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n\/\/ 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n\/\/ 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n\/\/ 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n\/\/ 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n\/\/ 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n\/\/ 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n\/\/ 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n\/\/ 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n\/\/ 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n\/\/ 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n\/\/ 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n\/\/ 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n\/\/ 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n\/\/ 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n\/\/ 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n\/\/ 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n\/\/ 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n\/\/ 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n\/\/ 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n\/\/ 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n\/\/ 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n\/\/ 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n\/\/ 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n\/\/ 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n\/\/ 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n\/\/ 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n\/\/ 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \n\nModule header:\n\nmodule fsm_ps2data (\n\tinput clk,\n\tinput [7:0] in,\n\tinput reset,\n\toutput [23:0] out_bytes,\n\toutput done\n);\n","role":"user"}],"name":"fsm_ps2data"}

This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n\/\/ When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n\/\/ When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n\/\/ If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.
